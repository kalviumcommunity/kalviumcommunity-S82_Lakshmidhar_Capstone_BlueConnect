# 💼 Blue Connect - Capstone Project

**Blue Connect** is a labor platform built using the **MERN stack** that bridges the gap between skilled labor workers and people in need of their services.

## 📖 About Blue Connect

Blue Connect empowers both laborers and users by providing a platform where:

- **Labor Workers** can:
  - Create a profile card with name, profession, contact, and work description
  - Get discovered by users searching for services
  - View job requests posted by users and reach out to them

- **Users** can:
  - Search and discover nearby workers
  - Post job requirements
  - Receive contact from interested workers

The system supports **two-way communication** between users and workers, enabling efficient service discovery and opportunity access.
